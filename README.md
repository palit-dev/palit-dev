# Nice to Meet You

Hi I am Rudra. I am a Machine Learning enthusiast with an ardent passion towards Data and the story it tells. 
Currently, I am a student at Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) under the Department of Space, Govt. of India pursuing my Master's in Digital Signal Processing.

# Relation between Signals and Data Science

Signals refer to any continous time varying data, not just the Cosine waves appearing on your CRO. So what do you mean by continuous? Simply speaking, think of it as a 
number with infinite precision i.e., infinite number of digits after the decimal. However, a basic understanding of how computer system works tells us , data must be discrete in order to represent it in the Computer Hardware. Why? Because eventhough possibilities with the Software is endless but at the end of the day, everything is limited by its hardware capabilities.
The Precision that a computer system can accomodate is decided by the number of Bits the register supports. Hence, the computer can support only upto a fixed number of digits after the decimal point and that's what we call a digital data.

So now coming back to our discussion, Digital Signals are time varying discrete data. Now to make a bold claim, ALL DATA ARE TIME DEPENDENT. How? Because Data originates from Physical Systems and time is the fundamental variable.
So frankly it's just a perception. Knowledge is UNITED.

That's why have the pleasure to browse through this repository and indulge yourself into the world of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and ofcourse, Data Analysis!
